This repository hosts the Chrome Extension Developers Group.

**Author:** Guilherme Dellagustin

## Objectives

1. Ensure and accelerate the continuous improvement of the Chrome Extension Ecosystem to improve the quality of life of extension users and developers,
2. Ensure and accellerate the continuous improvement of the Chrome Web Store,
3. Ensure and accellerate the continuous improvement of the Chrome Extension Review process.

## History and Motivation

After joining the [Google Groups for Chrome Extensions][google-groups-for-chrome-ext], the author of this project realized that several developers were having problems with keeping extensions live and up to date due to Google's processes with respect to extension publishing.

Evidence was present that the review and publishing process was not transparent to developers, and many times, rejections were only generically explained, without sufficient details or guidance, that would enable developers to efficiently correct issues and reattempt to publish.

Evitende was also present that the review process took a long time (days) and delayed the deployment of new features and sometime critical bug fixes, harming both developers and users of the extensions.

The author therefore reached the conclusio,n that the support offered by Google to extension developers was unproportional to the value added to Google's ecosystem, by the result of the work of the developers.

As such the author decided to create a project that would give the means for the developers to create a united front to negotiate with google for better environment and processes that will at the end benefit (in order of priority):
1. Users of the extensions
2. Extension Developers
3. Google

## Visions
- Create a more general group - Browser Extension Developers Group
  - Upstream to this new group all that is browser independent
  - Narrow the activities
