# Chrome Extension Developers Group

This repository hosts the Chrome Extension Developers Group.

## Objectives

The objective of this group is to join forces and steer the processes and tools related to the Chrome Extensions ecosystems, that are owned by Google.

## History and Motivation

As shown by several threads in the [Google Groups for Chrome Extensions][google-groups-for-chrome-ext], Google's review process and handling of extensions is intransparent and often extensions are taken down or have their publishing denied or delayed without a clear reason.

## Roadmap

To see the ongoning and planned activites, refer to the [General Project](https://github.com/orgs/chrome-extension-developers/projects/1).
