# Chrome Extension Developers Group

This repository hosts the Crhome Extension Developers Group.  
The objective of this group is to join forces and steer the processes and tools related to the Chrome Extensions ecosystems, that are owned by Google.

## History and Motivation

As shown by several threads in the [Google Groups for Chrome Extensions][google-groups-for-chrome-ext], Google's review process and handling of extensions is intransparent and often extensions are taken down or have their publishing denied or delayed without a clear reason.
